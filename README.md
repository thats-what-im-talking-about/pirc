# pirc

Pirc.com is a web site that I worked on starting in late 2011.  Well, actually I started building a different site in 2011 which was called Circupon.com, but we rebranded a couple years later to Pirc.com.  My friend Nathan heard the name Circupon and told me all he thought was "circus and tampon".  Thanks Nate.  With the rebranding we went to a far more coveted 4-letter domain name.  A domain name that I always mis-type as pric.  Whatever.

The creation of Pirc/Circupon coincided with my ["Re-tooling"](http://bplawler.tumblr.com) blog, which chronicles my effort to learn Scala and other technologies.  Now that I have been working at that for a long time, I have started another chronicle, this time on Medium, called ["That's What I'm Talking About"](https://medium.com/thats-what-i-m-talking-about) which will attempt to rewrite Pirc from the ground up.  Note that I won't be bringing over the original source code from [Pirc.com](http://pirc.com), which is still up and running in production.  Rather, I will be using it as a teaching tool and gradually rebuilding it here as an accompanyment to the work that's happening over in TWITA.
